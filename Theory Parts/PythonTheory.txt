1. Introduction To python:
*Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn, interpreted programming language used for web apps, automation, AI, etc.


2. History:
*Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum.


3. Features:
* Easy to learn and use
* High-level language
* Interpreted language
* Object-oriented
* Large standard library
* Cross-platform
* Open Source


4. Advantages and Disadvantages:
* Advantages: 
    1. Easy to learn. 
    2. fast development.
    3. large community.
    4. cross-platform.
* Disadvantages: 
    1. low performance
    2. limited multithreading support.


5 .Applications of Python:
* Web development (e.g., Django, Flask)
* Data analysis and science (e.g., NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib)
* Automation (e.g., scripting, data scraping)
* Artificial intelligence and machine learning (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras)
* Scientific computing (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Pandas)
* Gaming (e.g., Pygame, Pyglet)

6. Library Functions:
*   `print()`: prints output to the screen
*   `input()`: gets user input
*   `len()`: returns the length of a string or list
*   `range()`: generates a sequence of numbers
*   `list()`: creates a list from a sequence
*   `tuple()`: creates a tuple from a sequence
*   `dict()`: creates a dictionary from a sequence of key-value pairs
*   `set()`: creates a set from a sequence of unique elements
*   `str()`: converts a value to a string
*   `int()`: converts a value to an integer
*   `float()`: converts a value to a floating-point number
*   `bool()`: converts a value to a boolean value
etc.


7. Keywords:
*Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings. 
*Cannot be used as variable names or Function name.
*Some common keywords include:
    1. if
    2. else
    3. for
    4. while
    5. def
    6. class
    7. try
    8. except
    9. finally
    10. with


8. variables:
*In Python, a variable is a name given to a value. The value can be a number, a string, a list, a dictionary, etc.
*Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program.
*So, There are Single and Multiple variables in python.
*Single variable is used to store one value at a time. Example, x = 5
*Multiple variables are used to store multiple values at a time. Example, x, y, z = 5, 10, 15


9. Data Types:
*Datatypes means the type of data that a variable can hold.
*In Python, different types of data are stored differently.
*There are Two Types of Datatypes : Sngle Value and Multi/Collection DataTypes.
*So, In Single Values:
    1. int
    2. decimal
    3. complex
    4. boolean(True/False)
*AND, In Multi/Collection Values:
    1. str
    2. list
    3. tuple
    4. set
    5. dict


10. Slicing:
*Slicing means cutting parts of a string, list or tuple.
*It is use to select the a range of a items.
*Syntax:
    data[start:end]
    - start: Starting index (included)
    - end: Ending index (excluded)
*Example:
    text = "Python"
    print(text[0:2]) # Output: 'Py' (From index 0 to 1)
    print(text[2:5]) # Output: 'tho' (From index 2,3,4)
    print(text[-1]) # Output: 'n' (Last Character)


11. Typecasting:
*Typecasting means converting one Datatype into another.
* Example: converts string to int, float to int, etc.
    1. x = "100"
       y = int(x)          # Now y is interger 100

    2. a = 5
       b = str(a)          # Now b is string '5'

    3. c = 3.7
       d = int(c)          # Now d is integer 3 (decimal part removed)
